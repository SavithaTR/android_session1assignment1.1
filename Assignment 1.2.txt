1. What should be the output of the following Script?
   v <- c( 2,5.5,6)
   t <- c(8, 3, 4)
   print(v%/%t)
Ans: [1] 0 1 1

2. You have 25 excel files with names as xx_1.xlsx, xx_2.xlsx,........xx_25.xlsx in a dir.
Write a program to extract the contents of each excel sheet and make it one df.

  In a first step, we have to load the following packages:

   1 library(rJava)
   2 library(XLConnect, pos = 4)

  In a second step, we define the file type, we want to import (.xls), save the sheet names of the Excel files into a new vector called sheet.
names (since the sheet names in each of the files are identical, we may extract them from any of the 10 files) and create another 
vector (e.names) containing the names for the variables we want to import (in this case 28).

   1  file.names <- list.files(pattern='*.xls')
   2  sheet.names <- getSheets(loadWorkbook('Name.xls'))
   3  e.names <- paste0(rep('v', 28), c(1:28))

 In a thirt step, we create a data frame with 28 variables, named
v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, v6, v7, v8, v9, v10, v11, v12, v13, v14, v15, v16, v17, v18, v19, v20, v21, v22, v23, v24, v25, v26, v27, v28
and one row containing NAs only.

   1  data.1 <- data.frame(matrix(rep(NA,length(e.names)),
   2                         ncol = length(e.names)))
   3  names(data.1) <- e.names
 
 Finally, we use 2 for-loops to import all the files and sheets and bind them to a data frame we can use for analysis.



   1  for (i in 1:length(file.names)) {
   2   wb <- loadWorkbook(file.names[i])
   3   for (j in 1:length(sheet.names)) {
   4    ss <- readWorksheet(wb, sheet.names[j], startCol = 2, header = TRUE)
   5    condition <- rep(sheet.names[j], nrow(ss))
   6  sub.id <- rep(file.names[i], nrow(ss))
   7      s.frame <- seq(1:nrow(ss))
   8        df.1 <- data.frame(sub.id, condition, s.frame, ss)
   9       names(df.1) <- e.names
  10      data.1 <- rbind(data.1, df.1)
  11       rm(ss, condition, s.frame, sub.id, df.1)
  12   }
  13      rm(wb)
   14 }

3. If the above 25 files were csv files, what would be your script to read?
    Comma separated files (.csv) are much easier to work with. It’s best to save these files as csv before reading them into R. 
    If you need to read in a csv with R the best way to do it is with the command read.csv. 
   Here is an example of how to read CSV in R:
    # Read CSV into R
   MyData <- read.csv(file="c:/TheDataIWantToReadIn.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")
   The above reads the file TheDataIWantToReadIn.csv into a data frame that it creates called MyData.
   header=TRUE specifies that this data includes a header row and sep=”,” specifies that the data is separated by commas 
  (though read.csv implies the same I think it’s safer to be explicit).

   Note that the above includes the file path (the c:/). If you’ve already set a working directory in R you can just list the file, like this:
   # Read CSV into R
   MyData <- read.csv(file="TheDataIWantToReadIn.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")
